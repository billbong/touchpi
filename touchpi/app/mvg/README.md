## mvg app

### Introduction
This app shows when a public transportation at a certain starting point will leave and when a connection of a second transportation will leave. 

The upper semicircle shows the departure times of the first transportation.

The lower semicircle shows the departure times of a second transportation.

### How to use
* Get your public transportation stop id
  * Go to Google maps and locate your latitude and longitude of your first stop
  * Enter the url in a browser for getting a station id: https://www.mvg.de/api/fib/v2/station/nearby?latitude=nn.nnnnnnnnnnnnnnn&longitude=nn.nnnnnnnnnnnnnnn (replace nn.nnn)
  * Search for the globalID
* Create your URL for getting the departure times. 
  * Use the globalID.
  * Filter your transport types
  * Plan your offset of the start time. If you need 5 min from your location to the public transportation stop, then add 5 min offsetInMinutes
  * Update your mvg_public_transport_url1 in mvg.local.toml 
* Create your second URL analogues
  * For your second transportation add more offsetInMinutes. You want to check which transports a reachable. 
* Set destination of transports
  * Find in the MVG plans all possible destinations for your transports.
  * You can also just call the created URLs in the browser at different times and get the destinations there
  * Update your destination filter for both transportation in mvg_possible_destination in mvg.local.toml
* Change some colors in your mvg.local.toml file
